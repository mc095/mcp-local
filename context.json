Seeing him say goodbye to Murph and watching him float in the vast emptiness of space is a gut-wrenching moment. It's a reminder of the sacrifices he's making for the future of humanity and the distance that exists between him and the people he loves.\n\nAnd then, of course, the scene is made even more emotional by the discovery of the tesseract and the message from Murph in the past. It's a beautiful and clever way to show that even in the vastness of space and time, humanity is always connected and that love can transcend even the most impossible distances.\n\nWhat did you think of that scene? Did it move you to tears or did it give you a sense of wonder and awe?"
